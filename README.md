TomBotly was a Twitter bot, back when Twitter bots were cool. It attempted to create Tom Swifty jokes from people's tweets by:

1. Searching Wordnik for synonyms of each word in the tweet
2. Checking for a valid "-ly" adverb form of each synonym
3. Picking an adverb at random.

This mostly did not result in funny jokes, @mcmoots said drolly.

Unfortunately or otherwise, TomBotly's actual output has been consumed by the mists of time - I forgot to download its Twitter archive before its account was deleted due to inactivity.
